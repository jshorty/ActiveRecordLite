# ActiveRecordLite
This is a simple clone of ActiveRecord made for practice in metaprogramming with Ruby.
It lays the foundation for the valuable association methods used in Rails to quickly build complex SQL queries on multiple tables in the database.
In the example database with the repo it's used like any good framework should, organizing cat data!
